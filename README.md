### About the game
This game is aimed at Japanese students learning English, but the base functionality can be used as a board game for any class or occasion (The gameplay functionality works independently).

The game has been created with the intention that the teacher controls the game, where students can select a block to flip.

The aim of the game is for a team to score the highest points without being wiped out (As of now the wipeout functionality resets all teams scores to 0).

### Current functionality
- You can select the grade and questions are changed accordingly
- There's a difficulty slider that adjusts the chance of a wipeout appearing
- The team size can be from 1 to 18 teams (check settings)
- You can show/hide the team score (hidden by default)
- A random student selector is available by student number (it's possible to add a gap if boys/girls start at a different number)
- Select from a list of questions
- Set the theme for the blocks

### Plans for upgrades
##### Short Term
- ~~Adding more animations and sounds to the gameplay~~ (Added)
- Settings section for more user friendly gameplay (in-progress)
- Randomly pick a block to flip (This only displays a random choice currently)
- Adding mutiple questions sets per game (only 1 selectable currently)
- Allow the possiblity of themes for background

##### Long Term
- Getting questions from an API
- Save states in web export
